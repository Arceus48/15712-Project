## PostgreSQL Database Management System
This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

	https://www.postgresql.org/download/

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
https://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at https://www.postgresql.org/.

Environment setup: (for details, refer to: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html)
1. Create a EC2 machine with Ubuntu 20.04. Sign in to the VM using the user name "ubuntu".
2. Install packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo install gcc make libreadline8 libreadline-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev build-essential bison postgresql-client llvm clang flex
```
3. Clone the repository and use the master branch (it is the REL\_14\_STABLE for the postgres original repo).
4. Build and install postgres
```bash
./configure --with-llvm
make
sudo make install
```
5. Set the environment variable for ubuntu. You can add it to ~/.bashrc
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH
```
6. Start the postgres:
```bash
# Create the data folder
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data stop
sudo rm -r /usr/local/pgsql/data/*
rm logfile
sudo mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
sudo chown ubuntu /usr/local/pgsql/data
initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start
```
7. Play with the psql
```bash
# Create a database
createdb test
psql test
```

8. Set up llvm
```bash
psql test
set jit='on';
set jit_above_cost=5;
set jit_inline_above_cost=10;
set jit_optimize_above_cost=10;
show jit;
show jit_above cost;
```

To see the JIT explain:
```bash
# Create a sample database
set max_parallel_workers_per_gather=0;
set enable_bitmapscan=off;
create table t1 (id int, val int);
insert into t1 (select (random()*100)::int, (random()*100)::int from generate_series(1, 800000) as g);
prepare foo as select val from t1 where id=10;
prepare foo(int) as select sum(val) from t1 where id=$1;
explain analyze execute foo;
create index lala on t1(id);
```

See [this post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/19/installing-and-configuring-jit-in-postgresql-11/)

Disable multi-threading:
```bash
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 0;
```
